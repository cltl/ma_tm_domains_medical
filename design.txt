Data:
4,993 abstracts - only Starting Spans contains all fully annotated data.
Train/test split maintained for all docs (~4700/190)
NOTE: ebm_nlp_2_00 seems to have differing numbers of tokens (in /documents) and labels (in /annotated).

Input:
- Raw data from EBM-NLP (to retrieve the labels)
    * now directly imported from tarfile in data/raw and saved in data/raw.pkl.

- Features from StanfordCoreNLP
    * currently seems very difficult to achieve because of tokenizer disagreement.
    * tried inputting tokenized data, also returned a different tokenization.
    * probably need to use a different method to parse dependencies for the existing tokenization.


Processing pipeline:
- preprocessing script imports raw data into tokenized, labeled sequences
- next step: NLP pipeline
-> lowercase
-> punctuation handling
-> stop word removal / tagging??
-> number replacement (strings like ['0.01','2'] replaced with a tag)? note: not amod
more steps?

- Note that removing words also results in removal of sequence labels, which makes the postprocessing more difficult.
  might be better to avoid and stick to only replacing values with tags such as 'math punctuation'?
- should happen before building the vocab for W2V


Feature extraction:
Only approaches that allow for input of tokenized data can be easily matched to the labeling annotations in the data.
We could ask Roser about how to handle this, dependency relationship approaches seem very difficult.

Simple features:
Lag column(s) (up/down, document level)
NLTK POS tagging
Model needs an explicit understanding of sentence demarcation.

Complex features:
StanfordNLP: tough to extract/align, cannot take tokenized data
Other deprel parser (nltk built-in)?
Word2Vec: data must be one hot coded before applying algorithm to preserve labeling
- word2vec outputs a lookup table for probabilities -> how to transform these to features?
- probably not add them raw. possibly use KNN or another unsupervised clustering algorithm to generate
  a cluster label column.


Model:
Potential approaches:
Tree forest w/ skl (straight-forward and interesting)

Bagging/boosting with libraries? (XGBoost)

Decent approach for the paper:
Prepare 2-3 feature sets using different approaches (deprel parsing, word2vec), train model on subsets of the features
and compare / see how useful they are. Comparison of F-scores, etc. makes for useful results.


Post-processing:
Convert binary columns to B -, I -, E - sequences for each PIO cat
could try a simple procedure like unifying labels broken by less than 1-2 words

Output:
Extracted P, I, O sequences associated with an abstract
Useful for PubMed/other database search engine
Emphasis on high recall, completeness of sequences
Different goal from EBM-NLP authors

depending on how we handle stop word removal etc...
- Sequences could be extracted using aggregation and filtering techniques. E.g. a sliding window that annotates
something as 1 if, for example, 3/7 values in the surrounding window are 1.

Evaluation:
Apart from f-scores and model performance...
Error analysis: Print generated labels for ca. 100 abstracts and review them, implement fixes for common errors
